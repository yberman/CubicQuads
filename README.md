# CubicQuads

A repository for work on immersing 8-vertex cubic graphs into quad meshes

# Files

## KnownCubics.txt 

A file with the edge list of all known cubic graphs on 8-vertices with titles
supplied by Vance.

It contains their title, and is presented as a newline deliminated list of
edges.  Graphs are separated by pairs of newline.

## CQsWithoutRadials.txt

This is a list of all the interesting CQs that we have discovered (without
their radials). The first set of graphs were generated with Nauty. They include
all CQs with up to 22 vertices.  

After that, we have the CQs generated by the cut-and-paste method.  We only
store the ones whose underlying cubic graph was "new" at the time of its
generation. You can tell these graphs from the ones generated by nauty because
they have vertex indices >= 1000.

It uses an adjacency table format.

## identifyCQsAndRadials.py

Reads from `KnownCubics.txt` and `CQsWithoutRadials.txt`. For each CQ in
`CQsWithoutRadials.txt`, it extracts the underlying cubic graph and prints out
its title from `KnownCubics.py`.  It thent takes the radial of that CQ,
extracts its underlying cubic graph, and prints out the title from KnownCubics.
Finally, it enumerates the titles of the cubics in KnownCubics for which we
have not discovered an immersing CQ.
